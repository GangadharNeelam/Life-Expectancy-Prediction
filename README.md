# Life-expectancy-prediction

## Objective
Objective is to develop a model which predicts the life expectancy in a country based on different features

## Understanding
The observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.

## Approach
* Data collection
* Data wrangling
* Exploratory data analysis
* Model building
* Model evaluation
* Parameter tuning
* Model performance
